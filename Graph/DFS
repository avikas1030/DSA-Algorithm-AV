This is the most simple implementation of Depth First Search. As described in the applications it might be useful to also compute the entry and exit times and
vertex color. We will color all vertices with the color 0, if we haven't visited them, with the color 1 if we visited them, and with the color 2, 
if we already exited the vertex.

# code - 
vector<vector<int>> adj; // graph represented as an adjacency list
int n; // number of vertices

vector<int> color(n);

vector<int> time_in(n), time_out(n);
int dfs_timer = 0;

void dfs(int v) {
    time_in[v] = dfs_timer++;
    color[v] = 1;
    for (int u : adj[v])
        if (color[u] == 0)
            dfs(u);
    color[v] = 2;
    time_out[v] = dfs_timer++;
}
